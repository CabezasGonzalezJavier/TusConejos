This project is going to be fun. We are going to ear money like **[Warren Buffett](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett)**. The way is simple, to invert time and money in things which at first you have to works short time, after that to ear money without more work.

This method is a TSA(Turbo SEO Affiliate Commerce) with Amazon. This idea is based in this youtube video, which was create by **[Romuald Fons](https://romualdfons.com/crear-tienda-online-de-afiliados/)**

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the online visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid resultsâ€”often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a website appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search,news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services. The former instead is more focused on national or international searches.
